# Generating-The-Simpsons-Scripts

This is my third project in my Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation (Udacity). Using the template provided by Udacity, I added the necessary code to build a recurrent neural network, with TensorFlow, to generate scripts for 'The Simpsons' (a television show, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons).

The easiest way to view my code is to look at the .ipynb file.

helper.py contains helper functions that were provided by Udacity.

problem_unittests.py contains tests to ensure that I am correctly building my model as I progress through the project; provided by Udacity.

You can download the data for this project by using the .ipynb file.
